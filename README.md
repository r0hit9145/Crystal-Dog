ðŸŽ‰<b>Excited<b> to share that it was not quite easy for a fresher to search for an internship and learn on their own. Finally, after self-dedication, I got this internship. I completed my 1-month Data Science internship and received my certificate from Bharat Intern! ðŸ™Œ

Throughout this internship, I had an amazing learning journey:

Throughout my project journey, I have had a vital role, I make sure my comments at each step that I made step by step so that I can understand in the future when I need to go through.

Week 1: This is a crucial step in the data science process:

Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data science process. Here are some key points to consider:

Handling Missing Data:

  - Identify missing data.

  - Decide on strategies to handle it (e.g., removal, imputation).

Removing Duplicates:

  - Detect and eliminate duplicate records to ensure data integrity.

Data Transformation:

  - Convert data into a suitable format or structure for analysis (e.g., normalizing, scaling).

Outlier Detection:

  - Identify and handle outliers that may skew the results.



Addressing Inconsistencies:

  - Resolve inconsistencies in data entry (e.g., different date formats, spelling errors).

Data Type Conversion:

  - Ensure all data is in the correct type (e.g., integers, strings).

Handling Incorrect Data:

  - Identify and correct inaccuracies in the dataset.

Standardizing Data:

  - Ensure uniformity in data (e.g., standardizing units of measurement).

Data Integration

  - Combine data from multiple sources and ensure consistency.

Week 2: EDA, this is an immersive crucial step and heartborn of data science.

Week 3: Data Preprocessing, learned how to use GitHub for version control and collaboration. I posted my project on GitHub and created a short video showcasing my work.

Week 4: Model building, passing this algo -> into a variable, and Model improvement

gnb= GaussianNB()

mnb= MultinomialNB()

bnb= BernoulliNB()

Finally - Pipeline it, into Streamlit (API)


A big thank you to @bharatintern for this incredible opportunity and valuable experience. Looking forward to applying what I've learned and growing further! ðŸ“œâœ¨
